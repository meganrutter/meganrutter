- Hello, I’m @meganrutter
- I work with the Registration of Complex Rare Diseases - Exemplars in Rheumatology (RECORDER) project at the University of Nottingham
- The RECORDER team have been compiling comprehensive SNOMED code lists for:
   1) Rare Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases (RAIRD)
   2) Inflammatory arthritis
- We wanted to share these codelists for the benefit of other researchers - please feel free to use them!
- These are living lists, so if you spot that we've missed some codes please let me know and I'll update them
- You can reach me on megan.rutter@nhs.net
